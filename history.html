            History of Christmas  
        </h1>
        <p>
            Christmas (or Feast of the Nativity) is an annual festival 
            commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily
            on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration 
            among billions of people around the world. A feast central 
            to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the 
            season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the 
            season of Christmastide, which historically in the West 
            lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some 
            traditions, Christmastide includes an octave. Christmas Day 
            is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is 
            celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well 
            as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral 
            part of the holiday season centered around it.

            The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, 
            delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in 
            Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When 
            Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room 
            and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child 
            was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to 
            shepherds who then further disseminated the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, 
            the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as 
            December 25. This corresponds to the date of the winter 
            solstice on the Roman calendar. Most Christians celebrate 
            on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been 
            adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in 
            countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern 
            Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the 
            older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 
            7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that 
            God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the 
            sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, 
            is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.
